# Deep-Learning-Classifying-movie-reviews
Two-class classification, or binary classification, may be the most widely applied kind of machine-learning problem. In this project, we will learn to classify movie reviews as positive or negative, based on the text content of the reviews.
Recently, I worked on a classic NLP task: sentiment classification of IMDB movie reviews using deep learning. 📊🧠



👉 The goal?

To build a binary classifier that determines whether a review is positive or negative — a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) with applications in customer feedback analysis, product reviews, and more.



📌 Dataset:

IMDB Reviews (50,000 labeled movie reviews)

Balanced: 25k positive / 25k negative

Pre-split into training and test sets



🛠️ Tech Stack:

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

Word Embeddings (Embedding layer)

Sequential Deep Learning Model



🧠 Model Architecture:

model = Sequential([
    Embedding(input_dim=10000, output_dim=32, input_length=500),
    GlobalAveragePooling1D(),
    Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
🎯 Training & Results:

Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy

Optimizer: Adam

Accuracy: ~88% on validation set

Simple yet effective — great results with minimal preprocessing!



💡 Key Takeaway:

Even with a relatively shallow architecture, deep learning models can perform remarkably well on text classification tasks when paired with the right data and embeddings.
